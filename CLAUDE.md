# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

Organization profile repository (`.github`) for BusinessPlus Community—an independent, volunteer-driven group of K-12 technology professionals who share tools and knowledge for managing BusinessPlus, PowerSchool's ERP software (accounting, procurement, HR, payroll) for school districts.

## Key Constraint

**README.md and profile/README.md must remain identical.** The profile version displays on the GitHub organization page. Always edit both files together.

## Repository Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `profile/README.md` | Organization profile (displayed on GitHub) |
| `README.md` | Root README (kept in sync with profile/) |
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Contributor Covenant 3.0 |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | How to contribute |
| `SECURITY.md` | Vulnerability reporting policy |
| `SUPPORT.md` | Support channels (distinguishes community tools from PowerSchool support) |
| `.github/` | Issue templates, PR template, FUNDING.yml |
| `docs/` | Member documentation |

## No Build Commands

Documentation-only repository. No build, test, or lint commands.
