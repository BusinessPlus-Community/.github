## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in one of our tools or scripts:

1. **Check existing issues** - Search the repository's issues to see if it's already been reported
2. **Create a new issue** - If not already reported, open a new issue using the bug report template
3. **Provide details** - Include:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, PowerShell version, etc.)
   - Screenshots or error messages if applicable

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea for a new feature or improvement?

1. **Check existing issues** - Someone may have already suggested it
2. **Open a feature request** - Use the feature request template
3. **Describe clearly** - Explain:
   - The problem you're trying to solve
   - Your proposed solution
   - Any alternatives you've considered

### Contributing Code
