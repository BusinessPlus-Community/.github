## Important: Community Tools vs. BusinessPlus Software

**This community provides support for community-built tools only.**

For issues with the BusinessPlus software itself (login problems, module errors, configuration questions, etc.), please contact PowerSchool directly:

- **PowerSchool Community**: [powerschool.com/community](https://www.powerschool.com/community/) - Knowledge base, support cases, and peer connections
- **PowerSchool Support**: Contact your district's PowerSchool support representative

The BusinessPlus Community is an independent, volunteer-driven initiative and is not affiliated with PowerSchool. We cannot provide support for the BusinessPlus software or access to PowerSchool resources.
